Create a new GitHub repository and push your current project.

Ask the user for the repository name, then run:

```bash
bash scripts/init_and_push.sh [repo-name]
```

This will:
1. Initialize git if needed
2. Create a new GitHub repository with the specified name
3. Set up the remote connection
4. Commit all files
5. Push to GitHub

Make sure to ask the user what they want to name their repository before running the command.
